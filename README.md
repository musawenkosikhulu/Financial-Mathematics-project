# Financial-Mathematics-project
In this project we explored the payoff for a portfolios on European call and put options. We calculate the returns, normal distribution with the same mean and variance, skewness, mean, variance and kurtosis of the returns. We continued to look at risk-free rate of 2% construct the efficient frontiers of the portfolios and the capital market lines with a little bit of Ornstein Uhlenbeck equation exploration.
